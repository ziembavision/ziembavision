<!-- ABOUT -->
<p><span class="special">Welcome!</span> I make music and connected ephemera (especially fragrances) under the moniker Ziemba, and am NYC-based. Since first making an incense for my <a href="https://ziemba.bandcamp.com/album/hope-is-never-3">debut album</a> Hope is Never, I've expanded the ways I use multisensory media to transform spaces. For example, in a commission with <a href="http://guerillascience.org/fire-organ-soundscapes-artists/">Guerilla Science</a> at National Sawdust, I composed original five-part a cappella music for Fire Organ, where the voices of the vocalists directly transformed the scent in the room, using a fragrance apparatus within the fire organ as the translator between the human voice and a continually changing scent. A performance at MoMA Ps1 involved a mist-laden fragrant fountain, while a Trevorshaus show encouraged viewers to slather their friends in scented lotion, and yet another show offered attendees fragrant lollipops made in collaboration with <a href="http://www.badtaste.biz/">Bad Taste</a>.</p>
 
<p>My new full-length album Ardis is a feminist sci-fi adventure and multisensory experiment. It will be released sequentially throughout the spring and summer of 2019. In March of 2019 I'll be music artist-in-residence at <a href="https://pioneerworks.org/">Pioneer Works</a>. I’ve toured throughout the United States and internationally, have held artistic residencies with Guerilla Science, and the French Institute in Fez, Morocco; and have performed widely at music and art spaces in New York City, including: MoMA Ps1, La Mama, National Sawdust, Fourth Arts Block/ Creative Time, Issue Project Room, Knockdown Center, Queens Museum, the Museum of Art and Design, and more. I have composed original music for Comedy Central's Broad City, Cocoon Central Dance Team’s film “<a href="https://www.snowybingbongs.com/">Snowy Bing Bongs Across the North Star Combat Zone</a>,” Fusion’s “Shade: Queens of NYC,” and more. I write about culture, music, and U.S./Mexico border issues for publications including Teen Vogue, i-D, Listen to This, and Ravelin Magazine. I sometimes lead the NYC iteration of Colin Self’s experimental vocal group, <a href="http://colin-self.com/xhoir">Xhoir</a>, and xhoral explorations have been a significant source of inspiration for me.</p>

<!-- ARDIS -->
<p><span class="special">Ardis</span> = <span class="special--small">Earth, the necessary changes having been made [<span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span>].</span></p>
<p>
Ardis is an imagined parallel world, and a very real place that you are currently located within. It is inhabited by opening portals using song and scent. An ardis is the point of an arrow, a nexus in time and space, shooting toward the unknown future. This particular Ardis is the pregnant present as it incubates future vision.
<p>
Ardis is inspired by speculative science fiction, feminist geography, and the feeling of ecstasy that can happen when a bunch of people are singing together. As an album and performative project, it has been fueled by collaboration. Please see the list of collaborators in the ABOUT section to explore the work of fellow Ardisians.
</p>
</p> 
Ardis is organized into three territories, and will be released sequentially throughout the spring of 2019.
</p>
<p>
<h6>Territory 1 to be released February 12th, 2019</h6>
<ul>
<li><span class="point">Scale</span>: Building to City</li>
<li><span class="point">Portal</span>: 5 songs, fragrance, scented candle, video, live concert</li>
<li><span class="point">Topography</span>: Dense urban development; towers and bridges set atop one another, a confusion of images and symbols</li>
<li><span class="point">Vantage</span>: Oculocentric, the beginnings of Ardisian-thinking, the conflict between hubris and utopicdesire, the limitations of individualism; the body as an ant in an army, or as a blood cell in an artery.</li>
<li><span class="point">Air Quality</span>: Smoky, Clouded, Empire Decay, Overwhelming</li>
<li><span class="point">Sound</span>: Loud</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<h6>Territory 2 to be released April 4th, 2019</h6>
<ul>
<li><span class="point">Scale</span>: Comingled Bodies to Bedroom</li>
<li><span class="point">Portal</span>: 5 songs, fragrance, body lotion, video, live concert</li>
<li><span class="point">Topography</span>: Ardisian boudoir, lit by a pink moon</li>
<li><span class="point">Vantage</span>: Touch language, soft plush, tangled tongues and limbs, a delightful jumble, the way time is stretched like taffy during orgasm</li>
<li><span class="point">Air Quality</span>: muggy and steamy, human animal musk, enfolded</li>
<li><span class="point">Sound</span>: Intimate, whispered, immediate</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h6>Territory 3 to be released June 6th, 2019</h6>

<li><span class="point">Scale</span>: Glacial Lake to Forest/ Mountain Range</li>
<li><span class="point">Portal</span>: 5 songs, fragrance, room mist, video, live concert</li>
<li><span class="point">Topography</span>: Three crystal blue lakes, each with their own distinct personalities, named Omega, Ozero, and Zero</span>; Mountainous and densely wooded; diverse fauna and web-like tributaries bound for the ocean</li>
<li><span class="point">Vantage</span>: Geologic time, the intelligence of a complex ecosystem, matter as it travels through cycles of decay and birth</li>
<li><span class="point">Air Quality</span>: Expansive, liquid and misty, a pleasant and transportive breeze</li>
<li><span class="point">Sound</span>: Adrift via clouds, constantly in motion and characterized by continually transforming relation; the sound is the listener and the listener is the sound</li>
</ul>
